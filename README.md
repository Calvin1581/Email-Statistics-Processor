# Processing Email Data
### This repository holds code files that read data sets of emails and then can run analyses on that data.

## email_preprocessor.py:
#### Takes input of a data set of emails and then can return information such as word frequency and
#### the most frequent words to make training data and testing data.

## knn.py:
#### Runs a K nearest neighbors learning algorithm to train and then predict
#### the contents of a given email.

## naive_bayes_multinomial.py:
#### Runs similar to knn.py, but using a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
